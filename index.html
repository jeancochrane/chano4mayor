                <h1>Hey Chicago,</h1>
                <p>We need a new mayor.</p>
                <p>Rahm Emanuel has been in office since 2011. In that time we’ve seen the <span class="ref-link" data-id="closure">closure</span> of 50 public schools, the largest in history. The city <span class="ref-link" data-id="clinics">shut down</span> 6 of its 12 mental health clinics. The Department of Justice found a pattern of <span class="ref-link" data-id="coverup">civil rights violations</span> by the Chicago Police Department, including but not limited to the <span class="ref-link" data-id="murder">murder</span> of Laquan McDonald. It’s time for change.</p>

                <p>Elections are coming up in February 2019, and last time turnout was <span class="ref-link" data-id="turnout">under 33%</span>. We can do much, much better—we have to, with so much at stake.</p>

                <p>We want a mayor who will fight for public education. We want a mayor who will reinvest in black and brown communities on the South and West Sides. We want a mayor who will address our epidemic of gun violence without the brutality of police or prisons. We want a mayor who will let the young people of Chicago lead.</p>

                <p>We think you’d be a great mayor.</p>
                <p>We love your music—we’ve been following your career from the first 10 days. We also love the work you’ve done to give back to the city that raised you. You represent Chicago on the world stage, and you do us proud.</p>

                </div>

                <p>We know you don’t think of yourself as a politician, and we respect that. But this election is an opportunity for Chicago that we don’t want to miss.</p>
                <p>We think if you ran, you would win. And if you won, you would do a good&nbsp;ass job. You’re already making change in our city: your work supplying coats for the <span class="ref-link" data-id="homeless">homeless</span>, your long-running <span class="ref-link" data-id="openmike">Open Mike</span> for high school students, and your million dollar <span class="ref-link" data-id="donation">donation</span> to CPS all demonstrate a commitment to empowering Chicago’s marginalized populations. You’d send a message that Chicago is ready for a new generation of leadership.</p>

                </div>

                <p>Let’s say you decide not to run. Will you get involved and help Chicago’s youth get involved in Chicago elections? Will you speak with candidates for mayor about CPS, like you did with Governor Rauner? Will you endorse a candidate who will fight for the South and West sides? Will you encourage your fans to vote?</p>
                <p>You don’t have to decide right now. 2019 is kind of a long way away. But the people are screaming for you, and Chicago is hungry for change. Think about it...</p>
