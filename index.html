            <h1>Hey Chicago,</h1>
            <p>We need a new mayor.</p>
            <p>Rahm Emanuel has been in office since 2011. Since then we’ve seen 50 public schools close, along with every mental health center on the South Side. The Department of Justice has found a pattern of civil rights violations by the Chicago Police Department, including but not limited to the murder of Laquan McDonald. It’s time for change.</p>

                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Elections are coming up in 2019, and last time turnout was only 40%. We can do much, much better—we have to, with so much at stake. </p>

            <div class="lyric-container">

                <div>
                    <div class="lyric">Sometimes the truth don't rhyme<br>Sometime the lies get millions of views<br>Funerals for little girls, is that appealing to you?<br>From your cubicle desktop, what a beautiful view</div>

                </div>
            </div>

            <p>We want a mayor who will fight for public education. We want a mayor who will reinvest in black and brown communities on the South and West Sides. We want a mayor who will address our epidemic of gun violence without the brutality of police or prisons. We want a mayor who will let the young people of Chicago lead.</p>

            <div class="lyric-container">

                <div>
                    <div class="lyric">I got some ideas that you gotta see<br></div>

                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Now is the time to ask ourselves: <i>who can be the mayor we need?</i></p>
        </div>
        <div class="section section-red hey-chance">
            <h1>Hey Chance,</h1>
            <p>We think you’d be a great mayor.</p>
            <p>We love your music—we’ve been following your career from the first 10 days. We also love the work you’ve done to give back to the city that raised you. You represent Chicago on the world stage, and you do us proud.</p>

            <div class="lyric-container">
                <img src="" alt="">
                <div>
                    <div class="lyric">I'm in love with my city,<br>bitch I sleep in my hat</div>
                    <div class="lyric-source"><span class="soundcite" data-id="266130725" data-start="0" data-end="407000" data-plays="1">Finish Line/Drown (2016)</span></div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>We know you don’t think of yourself as a politician, and we respect that. But this election is an opportunity for Chicago that we don’t want to miss.</p>
            <p>We think if you ran, you would win. And if you won, you would do a good-ass job. You’re already making change in our city: your work supplying coats for the homeless, your long-running OpenMike for high schoolers, and your million dollar donation to CPS all demonstrate a commitment to empowering Chicago’s marginalized populations. You’d send a message that Chicago is ready for a new generation of leadership.</p>

            <div class="lyric-container">
                <img src="" alt="">
                <div>
                    <div class="lyric">I got my city doing front flips<br>When every father, mayor, rapper jump ship<br>I guess that's why they call it where I stay<br>Clean up the streets, so my daughter can have somewhere to play</div>
                    <div class="lyric-source"><span class="soundcite" data-id="266129910" data-start="0" data-end="206333" data-plays="1">Angels (2016)</span></div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>You don’t have to decide right now. 2019 is kind of a long way away. But the people are screaming for you, and Chicago is hungry for change. Think about it...</p>
