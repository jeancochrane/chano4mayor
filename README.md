To develop, clone the repo, then run `npm install` in the directory. `grunt` will minify and concatenate js, compile scss to css and prefix it, and reload your browser when files change (requires the [LiveReload plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei)). Make sure you're developing with grunt running, or remember to `grunt build` before you commit.
